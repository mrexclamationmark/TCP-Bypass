**TCP-Bypass**

TCP-Bypass is used to bypass linux's tcp congestion control options (do no TCP congestion control and use qdiscs or minstrel instead for QoS).

**How to use:**

Replace Kconfig, Makefile and tcp_bypass.c in the kernel source directory (linux-x.x.x/net/ipv4/).

Run make menuconfig in the root of the kernel source directory and select TCP-Bypass (CONFIG_TCP_CONG_BYPASS) under CONFIG_TCP_CONG_ADVANCED in Networking support>Networking options>TCP: advanced congestion control

Also set net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bypass

**tcp_bypass.patch**

Version: linux-6.1

Copy the patchfile to your main kernel source directory and run "patch -p1 < tcp_bypass.patch"

**tcp_bypass_debug.patch**

This is a debug patchfile to see how many times a function is called (this was used to reorder the structs based on how many times the function was called in order to optimize it).

**Known Issues:**

None
